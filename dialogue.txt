Speaker1: (Mikhail) Hello, comrades. This is the "Laser Show 'Three Idiots'". There are three of us again, Lev hasn't left Saint Petersburg yet, but decided not to attend our celebration.
Speaker2: (Evgeniy) And thank God.

Speaker1: (Mikhail) As you wish, Evgeniy, as you wish.
Speaker2: (Yuriy) Well, we didn't have to move the couch, that's always a plus.

Speaker1: (Mikhail) That's true, I agree. They say last time when we talked like this, it was really cool.
Speaker2: (Yuriy) Really? Well, we can talk like this, closer.

Speaker1: (Mikhail) Of course, we can, but nobody actually does, especially me—when I turn to the left or right, my sound keeps fading; for you two it's easier, more or less. Evgeniy keeps leaning back in his chair, and you can't hear him at all. Hey, Evgeniy, we can't hear you at all.
Speaker2: (Evgeniy) Listen, considering how often I argue with you about burning issues…

Speaker1: (Mikhail) You mean you should have sat like this a long time ago, right? Or what? Or you could sit here, for example, with your back to the camera, why not.
Speaker2: (Yuriy) Do we have a burning issue this time?..

Speaker1: (Evgeniy) Listen, by the way, I finally came up with a bumper sticker for my car. I just don't like all those patriotic stickers because they don't fit my concept, but I came up with a sticker.
Speaker2: (Mikhail) Go ahead.

Speaker1: (Evgeniy) So, a sticker for the back bumper: "Thank Uncle Sam for Lend-Lease."
Speaker2: (Yuriy) Not bad, not bad.

Speaker1: (Mikhail) Witty, I agree.
Speaker2: (Yuriy) Actually, that's a good idea. I think we should write a liberal, but more peaceful response to all those stickers, like: "Let's not repeat it," "Once is enough," something like that.

Speaker1: (Evgeniy) "To Berlin—to the gay club."
Speaker2: (Mikhail) That's the best one, in my opinion.

Speaker1: (Yuriy) There you go! We'll make a "Gay Club" sticker…
Speaker2: (Mikhail) ...and sell it in our store.

Speaker1: (Yuriy) We'll just take the one that says "To Berlin" and add "to the gay club." All done.
Speaker2: (Mikhail) Or just paint it in rainbow colors. Good, good. And who are you going to thank for the victory, tell me, please? Oh, you said, "Thank Uncle Sam," that's fine.

Speaker1: (Evgeniy) Yes.
Speaker2: (Yuriy) "Thank Uncle Sam for the victory," right.

Speaker1: (Evgeniy) As our viewers can see, we're all in the same T-shirts today. And not because we're brothers or gay, but because (well, that too) our reader…
Speaker2: (Mikhail) The truth is out.

Speaker1: (Evgeniy) ...with the nickname "Papa of Princess Leia" made us these T-shirts with his own design, for which we're very grateful, respect to him.
Speaker2: (Mikhail) Yes. Farhat, the letter with the source file never arrived, please send it again. And apologies in advance. Because we thought, why not apologize. What difference does it make—Farhat or Ramzan.

Speaker1: (Yuriy) I thought another burning issue would be that… someone once again said it's time to ban masturbation.
Speaker2: (Evgeniy) Ah, onanism?

Speaker1: (Yuriy) Yes.
Speaker2: (Mikhail) Sorry, I'll just jump in…

Speaker1: (Yuriy) With a surname like that, yes.
Speaker2: (Mikhail) No, somewhere someone wrote: "Before submitting any initiative, deputies and their PR people should check how their surname looks on the internet, because Onishchenko saying something about onanism is a very bad idea, really."

Speaker1: (Evgeniy) Well, maybe. Yesterday, by the way, Vuyachich was telling me about working at serious publications like 'Life' or 'Afisha'... Basically, an exaggerated story. Some journalist who has good relations with a deputy calls him and says (this is not my joke, but Philipp's): "Ivan Vasilievich, how about we make a legislative initiative and ban toilet paper, for example?" The deputy says: "Let's do it." Accordingly, the publication gets the exclusive, they're the first to write about it, like: "When you submit the bill, please send me a copy." The publication gets the scoop, and first thing they print is that the State Duma is proposing to ban toilet paper, everyone wins—the publication gets the exclusive, the journalist…
Speaker2: (Mikhail) He made a breakthrough article.

Speaker1: (Evgeniy) ...yes, yes, and the deputy gets media weight. That's it.
Speaker2: (Mikhail) I knew it all worked that way. Damn.

Speaker1: (Evgeniy) No, really, it's no surprise, I just didn't think it could be so exaggerated. But, for example, Vitaly Milonov actually lives on this hype. I was digging around on YouTube and came across a video, frankly, my opinion dropped about everyone in that video… forgot the name; anyway, Anatoly Wasserman is hosting, there's some sea design and improvised boats, he's standing at the helm, and guests are sitting on either side. In that episode there were Milonov and Varlamov. Do you know what the point is?
Speaker2: (Mikhail) Damn, I need to watch that show, it's awesome.
